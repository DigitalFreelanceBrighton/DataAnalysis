Following a wider consulting career, for the past 10+ years I have worked exclusively with financial institutions to deliver change ‘on the ground’. Over this period I have held the role of Interim Global Head of Policy for a tier one global bank during a period of major organisational change; led mixed client and consulting teams to deliver global transformation programmes focussed on optimising and modernising client onboarding operational processes and technology; and further led the roll-out of multiple new derivative & conduct regulations across the front office and operations environments. Beyond brings together an absolute focus on client onboarding and CLM within financial services, the very highest quality people and an unwavering commitment to delivering against our clients’ objectives.

Over the past 10 years I have led the delivery of multiple large-scale implementation programmes across FTSE 100 institutions, including the global, design, development and implementation of a leading edge client onboarding system; the redesign and rollout of a revised global funds policy for one of the worlds’ largest financial institutions; and the successful delivery of numerous regulatory remediation exercises in response to both the FCA and the Fed. Beyond brings together an absolute focus on client onboarding and CLM within financial services, the very highest quality people and an unwavering commitment to delivering against our clients’ objectives.

I have interned in a financial service firm (Atlantic Swiss) in the summer of 2015, then, few months later, I have started an online student letting agency, which was challenging to build alongside my University studies and which I successfully sold 2 years after for £30k. In the October of 2016 I have opened a social enterprise (CIC) which was a catering Indian food business based in Coventry. I have learned how to manage money, people, cope with challenging circumstances, how to act as an intermediary, pursue investments, manage and monitor business operations. I have gain several skills in the property sector, through the business I have developed, but this experience enriched me of many other skills too. I worked in Foxtons as sales negotiator and now I am working for First Derivatives as financial consultant. However, in the meantime, I work with two business partners (A tech developer and a restaurant operator/ nutritionist) to launch a software that will help people to eat the correct food, anywhere in the world. We have successfully won 10k from a start up competition organised by a VC and we are now aiming to pitch for the first investment round. My side passion is property, in fact, even though I have sold my letting agency 3 years ago, I have opened a company called Audace asset management Ltd with 3 other partners and we are buying properties across UK. A little more about the skills and competences I have developed so far; time and money management, creativity, planning skills, attention to details, strong communication and negotiation, problem solving, proactive approach and personal control when working under pressure or handling multiple tasks.  I run an investment consulting business mainly focused on helping Start Ups to get funding and win capital raise competitions. The consulting business also offers an end-to-end service to Start Ups that need operational planning, process flow and an action plan to structure their organisation and get it up and running. https://www.linkedin.com/company/murge/  - https://www.murgeinvest.com I have closed a Proof of Concept investment round 3 months ago and I have now been invited to the final stage of an other investment competition, for my own Start Up in the Food-Tech space.

During my student times at the age of 19, the essence of entrepreneurship led me to launch my first company which was a true learning curve and since then this spirit stayed with me.  And yes, I also had my Corporate times where I had the honour to learn from some of the most talented Private Bankers and Investment professionals. Their guidance and advice shaped my passion for mentorship and giving the best I can to promising talent and start-ups combining the best of both worlds. Over the past 20Y my focus has been to make a meaningful difference and add value to every start-up I got involved with, every client I have advised or represented and every partnership I made. My expertise is in building businesses, investing alongside innovative projects with great people, mentoring & challenging in any capacity. My passion is to bring positive innovation to all. So, my job here is to guide MillGens to its full potential – that means supporting the brands who partner with us and ensuring our members across the world love using the MillGens platform. We want our MillGens cohort to enjoy their best life through the pursuit of health, culture, style and learning. We want them to feel enriched by being part of a global group that’s obsessed with good new ideas and supports them. And most of all, we want to facilitate discussion and the sharing of concepts and knowledge.

The over-riding focus at the core of my aim is to drive commercial efficiencies and improve performance.  One of the most innovative projects I recently originated and drive, a first in Europe, is a large scale solar cluster of projects not based on subsidized energy production. All of the energy produced is fed in at “grid parity” with no feed-in tariffs or subsidies. The projects are in Italy. Please connect with me on LinkedIn, or contact me directly.

Great, so do I 👋. In the last 8 years, Fuse Capital has served clients such as Trade Gecko, Monedo, Near, Voi, Tier, CreditNord, 90 Seconds, and a whole host of other up and comers. We help heal the growing pains known only by CFO's, CEO's, and Founders alike. Traditional finance routes don’t suit high-growth tech firms, we know this because we were one in a previous life.. (more on that later). By building bonds between scaling tech firms and risk-aware global funds, we empower growth. Some of the investors committed to supporting our clients are Soft Bank, Google Ventures, Balderton Capital, Octopus Ventures, Index Ventures, Sequoia, Impact Ventures UK, and many more. Having worked with over 350 disruptive technology firms, we’ve developed a unique position in the market. We know who's expanding, which sectors to look out for, and the inside scoop on where tech meets finance. It's thrilling to be at the forefront of change and connect with innovators, creators, and visionaries... those who are permanently changing the landscape we know today.  If you are keen to learn what is happening in the international debt market, please get in touch. I'm looking to collaborate with journalists, writers, podcast hosts, influencers, and all other content creators serving leaders in tech.

In that time I helped to design and market new protection products and train advisers on the importance of protection. In 2014 it was time to use this specialist knowledge to help clients directly, and Heath Protection Solutions was born.   Accountants have a relationship with their clients like no other professional service, being the go to resource for tax, business advice, business forecasting, valuations and more.  The accountant is uniquely positioned to know about the key factors of their clients business, inc any directors loans,  and be the one person the business owner(s) would be willing to listen to regarding their need for mitigating their business risk. Mortgage brokers know the value of protecting the home for their clients, they have a responsibility to talk about protection, but due to mortage volumes and increased compliance often find it difficult to find the time needed to dedicate to protection.  Working in partnership with brokers offers the client the best of both worlds.  Protection advice can be complex, there have been huge changes in the products provided here in the last 10 years, particularly in the Critical Illness and Income Protection market and I felt that clients needed guidance to make sure the products they buy are the most suitable.

I'm proud to be often quoted in trade and national press on matters relating to employer covenant and wider pensions regulation, which has lead to frequent requests for me to share my knowledge and thoughts at seminars, conferences and training sessions - something I very much enjoy. I have worked for many years in the pensions space, as well as finance, relationship management and public speaking and I was once a unanimously elected director of the UK's first Business Improvement District.  I joined the Pensions Regulator in 2007 where I took charge of cases on some of the country's largest multi-national schemes, drove the widely praised Open Market Option project and, latterly, led government relations.  This provided me with the unique challenge of managing the often complex relationships between the regulator / wider government and the opportunity to regularly brief and guide TPR executives, Ministers / Secretaries of State and 10 Downing Street on issues and strategy.  These are all skills that I bring to my role at Deloitte, leading on strategy and relationships for the Financial Advisory - Pensions (Employer Covenant) team. I am also one of the Firm's 'Mental Health Champions' and help to promote mental wellbeing in Deloitte and the pensions industry. I am on a never ending quest to improve my golf handicap and once sang, at my one and only gig so far, in the 100 Club on London's Oxford Street.

A graduate with a BA (Hons) in Economics & Politics and a stint in Direct Marketing, I started in the mortgage industry in 1994 at John Charcol.  In June 2000, I joined Cobalt Capital and was responsible for successfully growing the Cobalt brand from scratch as Head of PR and Marketing, helping them achieve numerous industry awards.   As one of the main founders of Coreco, I am now using my experience to build the Coreco brand which is now one of the UK's leading mortgage brokers, winning a trophy cabinet full of top awards along the way. As MD I look after the strategic goals of the company, the Brand, Marketing & Communications, as well as corporate, introducer & lender relationships. As the Press Spokesperson for Coreco, I am regularly quoted in the media with appearances on BBC and SKY TV as well as National and local Radio.  More commonly known as 'Monty' I am the author of a highly acclaimed Mortgage Blog and was voted 'Mortgage Strategist of the Year' in 2006 and “Mortgage Personality of the Year” in 2008 and again in 2020 at The Mortgage Strategy Awards. At the highly respected British Mortgage Awards, I am a double winner of the 'Best Press Spokesperson' Award in 2011  & 2017 as well as winning the award for 'Best Marketeer' in both 2014 & 2016. I also won the award for Best Business Leader Broker (11-50 brokers) at the 2020 ceremony. I also write, produce and host our popular series of Coreco podcasts 'The Property Show' and 'The Mortgage Show' as well as writing numerous articles and columns including the Market Watch column in Mortgage Strategy.

However, creating concepts and executing them, managing projects and collaborating with a talented team are things I have a great experience in, thanks to my creative background. I have been captivated by music and creative expression from as young as I can remember and it's what inspires me to want to create and then share that creation with others. Ultimately, I believe this is what a marketer does. My decision to study Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience) at University really enabled me to sharpen my innate understanding, compassion and empathy for individuals and their behaviour, which as a result, have become key skills of mine. My natural love for research and continuously wanting to know 'why' as a kid, encouraged me to adopt a self-taught approach to everything in life which, along with my University background,  has provided me with strong data analytics and statistical research skills. I pride myself in having a ‘let’s get sh*t done’ attitude but also understand it's important to enjoy the process along the way. These are values I like to solidify when managing a team and from what my experience shows, brings out the best in every individual and improves efficiency. My aim is to become the best in everything I do - with the ultimate competition being the person I was yesterday!

Specifically focused on clients with larger and more complex incomes. Also seeking partnerships where we can help firms with such staff such as Private Equity, Venture Capitalists, Tech, FinTech, Entrepreneurs, Start-Ups, Company Directors, Self-Employed and many more. Being one of the top London Mortgage Broker firms, we are very adept at helping all types of clients, whether you are a First Time Buyer, home Mover, looking to Remortgage, or need help with a Buy To Let, myself and the team have vast experience in these areas and a very willing to help. At Rose Capital you’re a valuable, respected client, who we would like to help, not simply a property transaction, as others in the property world may see you. We seek to work with you in the long-term from first home, through to debt-free retirement. I am very interesting in working directly with firms who's staff/owners/Directors/Partners have more complex incomes and may need more assistance when coming to arrange finance. As a business owner myself I know all too well the hoops and roadblocks you face. However, we are experts in presenting cases correctly which will secure you preferential terms, as we have many exclusive arrangements with both High Street lenders and Private Banks. As stated above, we will then help you manage the debt down and assist you in your journey to being mortgage free and financially independent come retirement. I am also very passionate about helping improve both my team and my clients mental health. Getting debt free is naturally a huge help in that area. However, we are frequently seeing the downsides of people facing burn out or specific events which adversely affects their mental health. If you fall into this camp, please talk to me as while I am not qualified to help you in that area, I very much am in understanding the impacts on you and am often able to obtain better terms for you on lending if we have an open dialogue about past issues. If I can help remove some of the stigma that surrounds mental health in finance, that would make me immensely proud to have such a positive impact on our industry.","2014","Managing Director","Rose Capital Partners","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5095918","http://www.rosecp.co.uk"," "," "," ","RichardCampo","London, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

Over the last 20 years I have developed company branding and, moreover, culture around forward thinking and strategic planning. Success is based on formulating long-term, one-page plans with specific goals, then breaking everything out into annual plans, and finally into 90-day planning that cascades down throughout my teams. I am a big exponent of the book ‘Rockefeller Habits’ and share author Verne Harnish’s belief that a company should never stop developing and that momentum plays a huge part in continuing success. This is reflected as an intrinsic part of my DNA, which is a major driver of my proactive professional acumen. My businesses encourage risk taking and yet, at the same time, uphold the instillment of individual responsibility over all endeavours to advance the company. A supportive environment means that my teams have always exceeded expectations and their achievement has fed through into our world-class, innovative products and services. My ongoing vision is of aggressive but sustainable growth as I look to manage the future of FAD Equipment Store, continuing our outstanding pace of product selection and growth. My industry experience includes oil and gas, shipping, construction, renewable energies, lifting and cranes, topside and tie downs, mining, entertainment, water bag testing, breakbulk, utilities, and military applications.

And my passion here has helped me stay relevant when this sector has undergone consistent transformations globally. The love for economics, started with my career at Bank Hapoalim where I was promoted quickly as the Branch Manager. Where I enjoyed serving and learning both - 'people' and 'finance'. After two decades of my dedication to this bank, I met Nissan Trif who seemed (and is always) one step ahead in his business and services. He was founding 'MoneyNetint' and his vision completely changed my perspective. Today, after 18 years of its inception, MoneyNetint makes me feel the same excitement as it did way back in 2002. What is MoneyNetint? A full package of payment solution - both pay-in and pay-out. A true one-stop-shop for businesses.  Going global, growing a team of exciting and dedicated talent and the uniqueness of growing MoneyNetint like a family, gives the employees and clients feel like family too. The excitement of staying ahead in business and being cared for as a family is the uniqueness of what MoneyNetint provides. It has been a pleasure being a part of the team that built MoneyNetInt, an Electronic Money Institution that provides leading payment solutions around the world for:  -E-Wallet Management  -SEPA & SWIFT Payments  -Designated IBAN  -Automated Clearing House Payment Services  -Credit Card Processing  -Prepaid Debit Cards  -Merchant Payment Solutions  -Cash Pay-Outs  MoneyNetInt enables clients to pay in local currency quickly and in the most effective manner while working with:  -Payment Service Providers  -E-Commerce Companies  -Gaming Companies  -Marketing Agencies  -FX Traders  -Affiliates It is exciting to be a part of this era in finance where digital technology is transforming the relationship between the banks and the businesses, using mobiles and digital banking. The way blockchain has revolutionized the way we do transactions. There is an embracing beauty when the money is not spent on the bank fees but on the valuable services. Being a people's person with a keen interest in finance for business, international payments, and international money transfers, I love networking and connecting to like-minded and passionate people with a similar interest. And discussing the endless possibilities and the new-age transformation of finance in the digital era.","2004","Director Of Business Development","MoneyNetInt Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2026228","http://www.moneynetint.com"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

In 2015 we established Munnypot, our direct to consumer service through which we were able to provide a proof of concept that 100% automated FCA-compliant financial advice can be delivered to the mass market.  From day one the Munnypot Enterprise solution was designed to integrate seamlessly with corporates’ systems complementing the existing products and services available. The solution enables financial institutions and advisors to set up digital financial advice services quickly and cost-effectively with a trained team of experts in this field.  Launching a digital advisor either stand alone or as a hybrid model opens up a plethora of business development opportunities for corporates by unlocking revenue streams, supporting advisers, reducing internal costs, expanding product suite and supporting end customers efficiently. In a world of evolving technology, this is the perfect digital advisor to complement the products and services financial institutions currently offer.

Our overwhelming advice to our clients is that understanding their options will allow them to make the right financial decisions to benefit them.  Of course, buying in an uncertain market normally brings financial reward but the reality of what can be borrowed and what realistically can be bought (whether main residence or buy to let) is a complicated process which we unravel. Alternatively, for our clients not in a position to buy right now, tying to low fixed rates brings benefit and security. Finally, for our clients that wish to sell, we are able to help you borrow 90% of the property price interest free, before selling in order to buy your new home, especially important in an uncertain market. Whatever your property thoughts, AS Financials totally independent advice led service will help you focus and achieve your goals. We are here for a sophisticated discussion to highlight some areas that can benefit you, whether you need a mortgage or not. Our focus is advice and our clients’ needs, not your mortgage.

Pay729 speeds up and secures employees when they take telephone payments. Rather than having to logon to a web terminal or run off to a payment terminal you just dial 729 during your telephone call and do the payment right there and then. Pay729 turns your customers telephone handset into a pin entry system so they can type in their card details rather than needing to read them out over the telephone. Simple, affordable and secure.  If you move away from hearing card details read out on telephone calls you also move away from monthly PCI-DSS non-compliance charges. Replace the charge with a safe and secure solution that protects your customers, staff and business brand.

There’s been a lot of changes to the financial industry in the last 5 years with new legislations and mandatory qualifications and so it really was the perfect opportunity for us to come into the market with a fresh approach.

Throughout the years, I have observed the apparent increase in difficulty for one to preserve their capital/wealth.  Consistent inflation, not matched to relative earnings, combined with the general uncertain times that we are living in, all contribute to a slow diminishment of one’s wealth.

To support my ethos, I have taken my company on a journey of a relentless pursuit to success in creating a strategy which preservers capital, whilst appreciating in value in order to also create a level of wealth and financial security.

Beginning my managerial career as Branch Manager at Wilts Wholesale Portsmouth at the age of twenty-four, I managed the business for six years. During those six years the business saw a growth from a £1.4 million annual turnover to a £3.4 million turnover within the first two years whilst maintaining our gross profit margin and achieving record profits over the forthcoming four years.  Approached then by Edmundson Electrical to manage their JBM Portsmouth branch; JBM Portsmouth at the time of being appointed had an annual turnover of £700k; within the first fifteen months of being within the position, business achieved in excess of £3.2 million sales whist again maintaining the heathy gross profit margins that the branch was achieving on £700k sales. JBM Portsmouth become the most profitable branch from a portfolio of thirty-two branches within the South East region of Edmundson Electrical.  Following the success of JBM Portsmouth, I was then promoted to Branch manager of Edmundson Electrical Crawley which was the largest (with regards sales) branch in the South East region with an annual turnover of five million pounds. Over the next five years sales increased in excess of ten million pounds and Crawley branch became the largest and most profitable business in the South East region.  Since gaining the experience from managing different sizes business over the past fifteen years, there was now an opportunity to create a business which will trade through multiple branches, with the first being our Crawley branch, each operating at a lower more manageable annual turnover whilst implementing all the key features we believe have given the edge in the market place.

Started as an electronics engineer in Japan where the culture of continuous improvement felt like a natural fit. Moved into customer facing roles. Whether as a field service engineer, dashing off to far-flung places at a moment's notice to repair a robot arm on a semiconductor processing system, or as a salesman, figuring out how an infrared camera could help a customer in the paper industry reduce waste, I spent my time looking for ways things could work better.  After a while, I became aware that there were problems that I didn't know how to fix. Things to do with ROI, WACC and SWOT. So I moved to France to study for an MBA at INSEAD, which taught me the meaning behind the buzzwords and gave me the tools to move into general management, where I've been for over a decade. The systems are more varied now and my screwdriver may be labelled 'Five Forces' but I'm still loving the challenge of fixing problems.","2016","Managing Director","Quorum Technologies Limited","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1595802","http://www.quorumtech.com"," "," "," ","tonylarkin_au","Greater Brighton and Hove Area","Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing","|🦆-default-invited","",

I made my first investment when I was 10 and used investment profits to set up Ionic Information.  Investment decisions are so important to both the investor and the wider society.  Which company can raise money on the stock market is determined by investors or their nominees – do your own research and be wise! Running a company is a challenge.  There are always processes that can be done better, new marketing ideas, improvements to how users use and understand each product.  In the end, it is an enjoyable process; if I didn't find it interesting I wouldn't do it. I got interested in computers in 1973 and bought my first computer in 1979 – an MK14 which I constructed with a soldering iron.  It had 128 bytes of memory but this was expandable to 256 bytes. So very exciting, the possibilities were endless. And now we have the internet, mobile phones and something approximating AI.  All that in 70 years.  In another 70 years the change may be even more dramatic.  I just hope medical advances keep me going to enjoy the ride. I firmly agree with Richard Feynman’s quote: “there’s plenty of room at the bottom”.  I’m far more interested in nano and molecular than cosmos.  We will make extraordinary advances with DNA editing, molecular machines, brain enhancements, novel materials with bizarre properties and other things we can’t conceive of today.  Society is changing dramatically – it’s scary and unpredictable but we have no choice but to ride it out – so we might as well do our very best embrace it.  Then there’s the family and friends. Love you all!

Many accountants have had frustrating experiences with insolvency practitioners – updates aren’t freely given and progress on cases can be slow which result in clients leaving the accountant when everything is finished.  At AABRS our insolvency solutions are carried out using specialised in-house technology, which results in a quicker turnaround time on cases and enables us to keep you up to date on a daily basis. This helps you keep your client after the case, due to the quality, speed and transparency of our solutions. If you are an accountant and can relate to the above, contact me today by emailing gb@aabrs.com or send me a private message on LinkedIn, and we will arrange a meeting for you with one of our specialist insolvency practitioners.","2018","Director Of Business Development","AABRS","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2572697","http://www.aabrs.com/"," "," "," "," ","London, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

I am an excellent reader of people, and am extremely competent when it comes to both fitting my offerings to people's needs, and to adapt my message for whomever I am working with. Part of this comes with my instinct towards asking the  'Why?' as opposed to just the 'What?', and to focusing on asking the right questions, and to listening to answers.  I am a thorough, process-driven entrepreneur, with a long track record of keeping overheads low, and driving fast, effective profitability for businesses. I focus my energies solely towards companies that are both transparent and demonstrate high levels of ethics and integrity. Fundamentally, I like to make money, but equally am driven towards products which do their job well, and which have a positive, ethical outcome to be achieved. This leads on to my company, Excel Dryer Ltd, where the environmental and cost-saving benefits sit well within my own sense of morality as a businessman. More on this in my Experience section below. Likewise, as a Director at The House Crowd, I was attracted by the democratising model of the business, which allows a wide range of people to invest, even small sums, across an effective, diversified portfolio of properties, whilst eliminating much of the legwork usually involved in property investment.

In 1979, I joined the Lloyds Bank Group in London in the Corporate Banking Division managing the Bank's relationships with multinationals both in the UK and globally. In 1981 I became Deputy Country Manager for the UAE and Oman based in Dubai meeting the requirements of corporates both indigeneous and international for local loans, trade finance, eurocurrency loans, construction and project finance as well as the personal finance needs of the wealthy owners of local companies and the ruling families. This exciting and satisfying first experience of the Gulf was followed by a period in New Zealand as Head of the Investment Bank in the country followed by time in the Head Office of the Bank in London reporting to main board directors and getting considerable exposure to Strategic and Business Planning. I subsequently held positions with the Bank as Country and General Manager in South Korea, Regional Commercial Banking Manager for the North of England and Scotland, Area Director for Commercial Banking in London and finally as Managing Director of the Bank's Asset Finance business. In 2002 an opportunity presented itself to go back to the Gulf in a completely different type of organisation running the revenue side of the businesses of Doha Bank in Qatar and Burgan Bank in Kuwait including Corporate, Private and Retail Banking as well as Treasury operations. Since 2007 I have been undertaking consultancy work for GVC most recently in Libya as part of the consultancy team of Booz Consulting as well as with Accenture and BCG in Europe.","2014","Managing Director - Strategic Alliances","Gulf Wealth Management Limited","https://www.linkedin.com/company/14412870","http://www.gwmholdings.co.uk"," "," "," "," ","Liss, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

With broad knowledge of global emerging markets across multiple sectors, I possess particular expertise in Latin America and am fluent in Spanish, Portuguese and French. Throughout my career I have delivered strong performance by building concentrated, balanced portfolios of stocks identified through rigorous fundamental analysis informed by assessment of macroeconomic and country-specific trends. I drive efficiency and boost profitability by seeking longer term, conviction investments that reduce churn and management costs. I also seek opportunities where market sentiment or adverse news depress prices beyond fundamental value. Process driven, I have established a clear and auditable investment process framed by robust risk controls. Seeking low volatility while identifying strong performers from a large investible universe has driven top-quartile performance in my LatAm fund over one, three, five and ten years. In my time at Blackfriars I have also consistently supported marketing efforts for the funds, especially in approaching institutional investors in North America. I am able to engage with a range of audiences and can convey complex ideas to both technical and non-technical people. I would welcome contact from fellow investment professionals or anyone who shares my passion for tennis and padel. My areas of expertise include: Portfolio Management, Stock Analysis & Selection, Global Emerging Markets, Medium- to Long-term Strategy, Risk Management & Controls, Marketing & IR, AUM Growth, Top-quartile Performance, Low Volatility, Cost Efficiency, Portfolio Construction, Country Research, Market Analysis, Asset Allocation.

Together, and in different ways, my businesses help financial and investment capital flow into thousands of UK businesses. This is my passion, because I believe effectively deploying capital not only helps businesses grow faster, but brings untold benefits to entrepreneurs and has a positive impact on society.  To recognise the positive impact of capital on businesses I launched the Growth Investor Awards in 2015, 100 Stories of Growth campaign in 2017, Mindful Investor and the Growth Finance Awards in 2019.  100 Stories is an evidence-based, story-led, evergreen initiative that investigates the vital capital, incentives and support available to fast-growing SMEs across all sectors in the UK. Through research findings, founder storytelling and thought leadership, we are creating a roadmap for high-potential business success. Together, with 100 entrepreneurs, we are kicking off a much needed ‘capital debate’ in the UK. Through the work and commitment of my fantastic colleagues in all three businesses, we are teaching investment gatekeepers about the risks, benefits and ways of investing in small businesses.  While also uncovering the ‘invisible’ growth journeys of high-growth businesses and signposting where entrepreneurs can get the funding and support they need to start-up, scale-up and stay up.","2015","Group CEO","Indagate Group Ltd","https://www.linkedin.com/company/21149345"," "," "," "," ","AISummit","London, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

I believe that organizations that better connect with their customers can get to a place where they never lose a customer again.  &gt;In an age of personalisation and experiences, SMEs should focus on being unique. Excellent customer service is how SMEs will dominate the marketplace; customers will remember your service much longer than your price. I am a big advocate of putting the Customer First in everything you do, as repeat customers are way more profitable than new customers.   &gt;Following the era of “value for money” and “brand identity”, customers now demand personalisation and experiences. Faceless corporates are finding it harder to maintain the attention of their customers these days; an independent coffee shop can challenge the likes of Starbucks, just because of the way they make their guests “feel”. If you resonate with these thoughts, then I would love to talk to you further.

Or how, when people from many countries come together with a unified purpose, they can achieve the seemingly impossible, whether a $multi-million business in 50 countries or 5. The complexity is often born out of scale, technology, processes, or people, although let me not understate the enormous challenges and excitement of trying to recover or grow a business with unfulfilled potential. There is nothing more rewarding than helping people see through the complexity and find a new path to growth. I am excited about what I am now doing post-Covid by ‘productising’ my knowledge and experience, through online sales best practice auditing and business growth workshops. All still focused on helping businesses sell more by introducing sales best practice, implementing process improvement, and motivating people.

Have you contemplated selling up, but are unsure of your exit strategy?  Perhaps you’ve thought about finding an investor to help you get to the next level of turnover and you need help with the ins and outs of doing this.  As a business buyer and mergers & acquisitions specialist with eight years’ experience helping business owners ready to sell or seek investment opportunities, I can help.  I started my finance career in the late 1990s working as a consultant for various top ten London law firms. I then moved into consulting, and worked at boutique investment firm Mansford Holdings. It was during this time that I gained a deep understanding of the investment world. I discovered exciting investment strategies, and ultimately became interested in portfolio investments and acquisitions.  The M&A industry has a reputation for being notoriously unscrupulous, and I wanted to rebel against this. Consequently, Verdani Investments was born.  We are a team of unequivocally straight-talking investors who pride ourselves on our ethical approach to M&A. We align ourselves with our clients’ goals, and only buy or invest if we genuinely believe in the company’s objectives.  So how does it work?  First of all we’ll discuss your business performance and objectives and, if it aligns with us, we’ll ask for your last three years of accounts from which we make a valuation assessment.

This has been in the capacities of Sales Director, Commercial Director and Managing Director. Since forming CMS Electracom’s UK operation in 2009, my efforts have been targeted towards the development and manufacture of electrical, cable management, data and AV solutions to the office furniture market. Having succeeded in these positions, I believe I can demonstrate broad general management experience and in depth sales and marketing knowledge. I particularly enjoy the development of innovative offers and have considerable experience in the realisation of technical sales and marketing initiatives through market interpretation. This has included the founding and the development of an SME company.   I am also well versed in ensuring the viability of business not only from the prospective of future strategic direction, but also in the aspects of matching market opportunities with resources and skill sets.    This is further supported by being fully conversant in a business to business environment.  Previous responsibilities have additionally included the identification and the development of business in International markets.  To date these have been within Central Europe, East Asia, North America and the Middle East. Inevitably, I am confident at operating at all levels and have a high degree of interpersonal ability. I remain ambitious by nature, with a considerable work rate and very much retain the desire to succeed.

Highly curious. Thirst to explore. Necessity to improve.  Firms must constantly re-evaluate their purpose, client/market needs and how they do business, in order to stay relevant and impactful.  I help Financial Services institutions radically transform. Either by helping create, implement and realise their highly complex, high risk and high profile business restructuring plans (divestments, mergers, business transfers, legal entity optimisation, subsidiary set ups, which included leading Accenture's Brexit work across Financial Services UKI). Alternatively I help firms transform digitally, with a big focus on consumer/client.  With an active interest and passion in entrepreneurship, (there’s always a better way ‘it’ can be done) I help firms innovate at all levels and maximise use of all players in this very large ecosystem across Financial Services - an interesting journey when you dare to believe and disrupt, as well as operate. A passionate speaker and coach. Advocate and sponsor for diversity and inclusion as well as next generation leadership. Multiple business award winner.

I work with startups and established businesses on their sales strategy and implementation, to help them expand their businesses, locally and across borders, and to push forward in terms of expansion of products, territories, or innovations. I do this as an advisor and mentor, or non-executive director. For example, I am on the advisory board of the Fine Art Bourse.  I advise on technical and financial business decisions and processes and I also make relevant and useful introductions and build connections across global jurisdictions on behalf of my clients. One of the things I have noticed with entrepreneurs is that it’s really lonely, especially at the startup phase (but not exclusively!). Entrepreneurs must be very versatile and agile – with a great idea, a healthy amount of optimism, a belief in their product, an open mind, and a willingness to grow. They want more than advice. They want to have a conversation or “pick a brain” with someone who won’t judge, who has experience and where there are no risks or hidden agendas. I am constantly surprised which parts people find valuable out of each conversation. Over the past few years I have performed a number of interim independent, non-executive roles at operational and board levels. I do pro-bono mentoring for post-grad students at LSE and Regents University and am involved in the entrepreneurial schools in those universities.

We also understand that this process is not usually a means in itself – it is a means to an end. The long term objective is usually the financial security and freedom for you and your family to live the life you want to lead. This can sometimes get lost in the fog that can descend when running the business day to day. Our starting point is to help you understand exactly where you are in the cycle of being a successful entrepreneur and how this might relate to things you and your family want to do in the future. Our process includes the use of sophisticated software to show you clearly how things are likely to pan out. This will usually be based on any number of “what if scenarios.” We can then help you develop a plan to achieve your long term financial security and freedom.","2012","Managing Partner","CPN Investment Management","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2300493","http://www.cpnim.com","charlie@cpnim.co.uk","01243 819101","charlieontoast","Moneyontoast","London, England, United Kingdom","Financial Services","|🦆-default-invited|sent blog 2","",

Technology scaleup marketing grows at an incredible rate. You can initiate new activities, launch campaigns, take on agencies, and hire marketers at speed.  It’s tough to keep control of activity, resources value, or expenditure.  Budget is wasted. Efforts are wasted. Agency relationships deteriorate.  Too often marketing simply doesn’t drive the value and sales you want and need to meet your commitments.  When you make uninformed marketing choices, opportunities are missed. Events are lacklustre. Messages fall short. The wrong agencies are hired. Channels and tactics don't reach the audience.  I created services to help fast growing tech startups and scaleups to avoid exactly these issues.  They aim to help you make SMARTER CHOICES, gain and keep CONTROL & VISIBILITY, and conduct EFFECTIVE MARKETING for your business.   ♦ Marketing advice sessions and services to guide smarter choices of marketing directions and resources ♦ Marketing control as a service to help you monitor and manage marketing value and performance ♦ Marketing consulting services to meet your strategic priorities ♦ Marketing execution services to help you take action – or find the RIGHT resources to take action, via our network of partners and contacts or via knowledgeable agency search and pitch management.

By understanding the human element, you are more profitable, lead more effectively, create brand loyalty, close more deals and conduct better work.  Based in the Midlands, I am a business founder and investor with a trusted network of expert entrepreneurs, which has been thoughtfully and carefully constructed over several years. My unique service, excellent reputation and human approach has led to immense success in the financial industry, where I have founded a range of unique businesses through my investment into people.   15 years ago, I made the not-so-difficult decision to begin my own finance business. Although previous difficulties may have deterred some, I understood the importance of success, and so I opened Finance 4 Business and began trading within a week. My experience came from the Lloyds TSB Management Development Programme and my expansive roles across the Bank. This enabled me to provide a hugely different and bespoke service from my competitors. In the words of a then client, “We love dealing with you Russ, because you do everything for us.”  My experience with Finance 4 Business combined with my passion for people encouraged me to form a set of other businesses, where I invested in the best people in the country to create some of the largest and best businesses in the industry.  Our group of companies are: Finance 4 Business Liquidity Club  Innovation 4 Business Caliber Land  Walker Doble My investments into this community of strong and knowledgeable entrepreneurs allows us to provide a range of business services to support our clients in every way possible.  Thriving, even throughout the 2008 recession, we deliver a unique and fully integrated service. Our human approach has allowed us to form strong and long-lasting connections with lenders, banks and industry-experts across the country. In turn, our knowledge continues to grow with the times, so that we can remain able to provide clients with the top-quality service, advice and the solutions they need, even during the most difficult of times.

At first, I was the only employee and I provided IT consultancy services only to large enterprise with thousands of computers. My accountant asked me if I would help him network his computers and install a server for file storage and email, and he became my first SME client. I got a real kick of helping transform the way this small business worked. A year later, my accountant had referred me to several of his clients, and some more new clients came my way through word-of-mouth. I decided to give up working in large corporates and devote all my time to working with SMEs, helping them use technology to grow their businesses. Fast forward to 2021 and Superfast IT has grown from a one-man-band to a thriving business with a team of experts. Over the years I've developed a wealth of experience in growing and running an SME and worked with a wide range of clients. I still really enjoy going to work every day, growing our business, working with our team, and helping our clients use technology to drive their businesses forward.","2004","Managing Director","Superfast IT","https://www.linkedin.com/company/901300","http://superfast-it.com"," "," "," ","SuperFastCEO","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Information Technology and Services","|🦆-default-invited","",

Standing on the summit of Everest was the pinnacle of my life’s dreams, but it’s just the beginning. I want to share my experience working with international teams in extreme survival situations, to inspire others to push their limits and achieve their own goals. I run motivational seminars with companies around the UK sharing my experience and expertise in health, nutrition, team management and performing in high-pressured situations. I am also founder and director of Fitways Adventures, a training and expedition company running trips in the UK and around the globe; including the Himalayas, the Amazon Rainforest, The Andes and Africa. Our main focus is running corporate team building adventures tailored specially to our client’s requirements, offering meaningful, high quality team building experiences that make a real impact on how teams function and relate. Prior to launching Fitways Adventures in 2011, I enjoyed a highly successful career in IT sales, ultimately working as an international account director for Hewlett Packard. However, having spent many years trying to juggle my demanding career with my outdoor pursuits, I finally decided to follow my true life calling and launch Fitways. When I’m not busy running seminars or leading groups up Kilimanjaro, I love to learn new skills and pursue my own adventure goals, including: •	Completing the Seven Summits •	3 Ironman Finishes •	Running the Marathon Des Sables in the Sahara  – planned for 2019 •	Completing the Yukon 1000 Kayak race – planned for 2019 •	Qualified Climbing and Mountaineering Instructor •	Level 3 Personal trainer •	Diploma in Sports Nutrition •	Diploma in Sports Massage","2013","Managing Director","Fitways Adventures","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5510459","http://fitwaysadventures.co.uk"," "," "," ","nickatfitways","Maidenhead, England, United Kingdom","Leisure, Travel & Tourism","|🦆-default-invited","",

Networking this year has been unlike what I expected when I moved here from Texas in February - and randomly messaging other automotive professionals on LinkedIn only works half the time!

Since leaving school I have gained qualifications in Building, Civil Engineering, Architecture, Construction Project Management and Urban Design. I did my first architectural and engineering drawings at the age of 14, designing my grand fathers house at the age of 18. At the age of 24, I was the Regional Winner of the Master Builder of the Year Competition and the only reason I didn't get the National Award was I wasn't a member of the FMB! Since then, I have helped my previous employers gain Design Awards. Winning the Self Build Award myself from 'Build It' in 2004, after designing my sisters house.  I have created several companies which are growing from strength to strength, they operate in three primary areas: 1 Architecture 2 Timber Engineering 3 Building Maintenance and Improvement Specialties: Taking a holistic and pragmatic approach to urban design and construction, I believe that I offer an all encompassing knowledge that enables me to make quick and decisive design decisions reducing the time take to deliver projects to site.  But also when the work progresses on site, ensuring the buildings are built properly.","2019","Managing Director","HEPS heps360.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/11100815","http://heps360.com/"," "," "," "," ","West Midlands, England, United Kingdom","Construction","|🦆-default-invited","",
