Leaders often need to change the direction, culture, or strategy of their organizations. But they can't do it alone. They need their staff and teams 100% behind them. Building that shared sense of purpose and engagement is often the biggest challenge, and the single-most important ingredient for success. When asked, most CEOs and Executive Directors will tell you that they believe in the power of their people (board, staff, volunteers, investors, and donors). But for those who are searching for ever-increasing ways to unlock the power of their stakeholders, let's work together. Q: Need to change your culture so that staff take on more ownership?  A: We'll engage them in finding solutions.  Q: Have a board who wants to get to the next level of functionality, but doesn't know how?  A: We'll get them unstuck by providing them with structure to gain insights, bond as a team, and map out a plan of attack, along with accountability measures.  Q: Are your stakeholders moving in different directions?  A: We will map out a transparent process that culminates with a compelling mission and vision statement, as well as a process to ensure that we receive tangible outcomes.  A: Or we might create a strategic planning process and six-year living, breathing strategic plan, but only if the key players who must executive the plan take ownership of the outcomes, as a critical part of our work together.  A: Or let's embark on a new initiative to become a Center of Excellence. A: Or launch a company-wide Innovation & Business Development Initiative. A: Or prepare for and launch a two-day retreat for top customers or donors to get their feedback, and increase their engagement.  I'll tap my skills as a business consultant (Stanford MBA), stand-up comedian (opened for Joan Rivers), and former legislator (four elected terms to the Vermont Legislature), with more than two decades of strengthening dozens of organizations and coaching leaders.

In 1998, 5 of us co-founded Dealer.com, a digital marketing technology company for the automotive industry. I served as the COO for 16 years and grew the company to over 7,000 clients, 850 employees, and revenues over $230mm. We charted new territory for the auto industry in digital advertising. We successfully sold the company for $1.1B in 2014 and, to date, is one of the biggest success stories of entrepreneurialism in the state of Vermont.  With decades of experience in software engineering, digital advertising, running and scaling business, I, along with 3 others, detected an unmet need among industry-focused organizations in the digital advertising space, and in November 2017, we launched Fluency ( https://www.fluency.inc ), an enterprise-level technology automation platform that dramatically streamlines critical, necessary, but repetitive and time-consuming tasks associated with digital advertising management.  I also angel invest, run my family giving fund and serve on several boards to support the entrepreneurial ecosystem and my local community.

We ease the burden for them by defining goal achievement metrics and implementing a strategy that delivers leads and customers that make a good fit.  We do this by finding out how their buyers think and behave during the decision-making process, then we use authentic content and digital marketing to quality and guide those prospects through the buyer's journey. This includes blogging, videos, social media, SEO, and email marketing to name a few. My company, Creative Side Marketing, is a band of passionate strategists, content creators, and designers with one thing in common: We look at marketing a little differently. ►  We believe CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE is the most important way to DIFFERENTIATE your brand today. We accelerate growth for our partners by removing friction at all points of their relationship with customers. ► We believe in AUTHENTICITY in content marketing. Almost every piece of content we create comes directly from interviews with our clients or their customers, ensuring the end result reflects their values and their expertise.  ► We build our strategies from REAL BUYER INSIGHTS derived from people who have recently evaluated a solution like yours.  ► We PERSONALIZE our messaging so that it speaks to smaller segments of buyers in intimate ways. HUMANIZING your brand is very important to our results. ► We are RELENTLESS about hitting goals for clients. We helped one business gain 96 new customers that spent 3x more than the average in 2018. ————— Now is the time to level up your marketing and build a community.

And it all starts with understanding one moment. The one moment that matters.  In sales, we have to connect with another human being and persuade that person to say “yes.” Yes. We see the world the same way.  Yes, We share a belief in how things can change for the better.  Yes. I trust you and I want to start a relationship with you.  This is the moment. And yet, each time we step into that ring and summon up the courage to persuade, we often default to old patterns of persuasion. As a result, we leave that moment to chance. And we leave a secret weapon to persuasion locked away in its case. This secret weapon is the oldest trick in our human playbook.  It’s the shortcut that a select few know about. It’s a skill we were all born with. It’s the mind hack that sidesteps the fortress of objections.  Storytelling and its ability to quickly establish trust is the most proven, trusted and successful way to get anyone to say “yes.” Learn how to be a better storyteller in that moment, and you will learn how to become more persuasive.

My education began with my first company, a house painting business when I was in high school. I wasn’t old enough to drive so I found a partner with a driver’s license and we made 6X the minimum wage for two summers.  In college, I founded University Consultants to help small companies automate business processes with computers. This was my first experience working with business owners to solve real problems and I was hooked on consulting forever. I started my first “real” company, The Kodiak Group, at 30. We provided business operations and eCommerce consulting services to Fortune 500 clients throughout North America. We doubled in size every year and were profitable every quarter. Five years later, we sold the company to a venture capital-backed, pre-IPO roll-up. We rode out the IPO during the Internet boom years. After the bubble burst, we bought our company back in a leveraged management buyout and then sold it again after the economy recovered.  A career in small business ownership and big business consulting has given me unique perspectives on launching, acquiring, growing, exiting and integrating businesses. I’ve advised hundreds of business owners and executives in large and small companies in a wide range of industries, from industrial products and B2B services to healthcare and consumer products.  I’ve learned how important it is for business leaders to have experienced, trusted advisors to provide ideas and validation, especially when big decisions have to be made. Venture 7 Advisors provides exactly that kind of support - practical advice to help business owners build and exit their companies with confidence. It’s the best job I’ve ever had.","2016","Co-Founder","Venture 7 Advisors LLC","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10872683","http://www.Venture7Advisors.com"," "," "," ","Venture7Advisor","Colchester, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited","",

I’ve certainly had an interesting path: learning customer service at my father’s grocery store, hippie homesteader, furniture maker, expert ski boot fitter, and windsurfing instructor. Earned a master’s in psychology and was a member of a mobile crisis team. International business dude. Author of 2 books and gigging musician.  Now I work with small to medium-sized businesses to help them achieve better results and deeper satisfaction in my 19th year at Business Culture Consultants.  That's just the professional. The idyllic world of my 20’s was shattered by the sudden death of a neighbor. The thriving career of my 30’s blown apart by the tragic loss of my brother-in-law in a terrorist event. Finally, dealing with my “world-class substance abuse” patterns. Relationship crash-and-burn, stressful family stuff – you’ve likely experienced parallel events. As a mentor said, “If you lived your life backward it would make total sense.” Agreed! So how does this inform me and guide me in what I do now? First, I have empathy for how everyone is on a path of growth. I strive to be curious rather than judgmental. Second, while I’m a Vermont Licensed Psychologist-Masters I don’t diagnose and treat. It’s just a handy tool to have in my work.  Third, by being a Certified B Corp company I believe business should be a force for good, using a multiple bottom-line approach.  And I’ve become increasingly committed as a privileged white guy to support racial justice, gender equity, and a prosperous economy for all. Life is good, and life's been good to me, even though it seemed dark and confusing at times. But something larger prevails – a Mr. Lennon quote says it all: “Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe.”  ","2000","Founder | Chief Effectiveness Officer | Business Culture Consultant | B Corp Expert","Business Culture Consultants"," "," "," "," "," ","FlipBrownVT","Burlington, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited","",

My experience in leadership and management inside intensely competitive industries combined with my anthropological approach and devotion to serving others allows me to help others 'see differently' and therefore 'solve differently'   To help facilitate this growth. This is my purpose.   The common thread of my career has been in 'building bridges'.  Whether I was literally building homes or facilitating cross-cultural experiences--it has always been about building bridges and helping people connect to each other and themselves in deeply meaningful ways.  I am a servant leader.  I have started a small home inspection business which affords me the ability to continue to tangibly help people find 'home'.    Simultaneously,  I am pursuing the development of my next chapter which will have to do with helping entrepreneurs grow their enterprises and their capacity to lead their teams.   Healthy small businesses are the life-force of our communities.  They support not just the people they employ but all those associated with them.   Now more than ever, small business can serve to connect us, to remind us that we belong, and to show us a path to confidence and happiness.  It takes incredible work to be successful.  It also takes a remarkable amount of capacity  to 'relate to problems creatively'   This is where I shine.

But yet, I find that the lack of financial literacy is a common occurrence. When people understand how to manage their finances, closely held belief systems, which may not be true, are often replaced with facts. How money works is not complicated, nor does investing require unnecessary risk. The adage, no risk, no reward, is not always true.  There are many ways to increase a person’s financial potential while significantly reducing their exposure to risk. One way, the easiest way, in my opinion, is to identify how inefficiencies can create deficits. Simply recouping inefficiencies, in essence giving money back to themselves, it’s possible for people to achieve greater financial success, potentially even exceeding their goals with little to no additional out-of-pocket cost or risk.  It’s a holistic approach to managing and growing assets. Once people understand how each piece of the puzzle works, it’s easy to integrate disparate parts into a cohesive and flexible plan. It’s an imperative that YOU understand the financial implication of each move before YOU make it. Most people work 40 to 50 years and need money throughout their life while trying to save for retirement. In my experience, these same people are often dismayed at how little they saved.  Many of my clients choose to work with me to follow this process. They are taught to evaluate the guidance I provide and seek transparency in their financial choices, enabling them to make the right decisions.  The educational process is a means to an end. Financial literacy is ultimately about YOU. That you should be part of the process of managing your money. You should understand who’s got your money, where it is, and how it’s doing. Too often people just abdicate control.  I would love to meet with you to tell you more about the process. Feel free to call, email or message me.  ","2000","Partner","C.K.

The Vermont Community Loan Fund (VCLF) is a dynamic nonprofit Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) that works to accomplish this goal.  We focus on businesses and programs that help lower-income Vermonters access safe, affordable homes, quality jobs, child care and essential community services.  Since making our first loan back in the spring of 1988, the Loan Fund has made over 1000 distinct loans totaling over $100 million that created or retained jobs for 4,000 Vermonters, child care slots for 3,500 children, built or rehabilitated 3,500 affordable homes and financed community organizations serving hundreds of thousands of Vermonters.  VCLF also provides an investment opportunity for Vermonters who want to have a social and local impact with their money. Over 450 investors have lent VCLF $30 million in capital. These investors provide the fuel for our loan programs and in return receive a financial return and know that their money is having real impact in Vermont.","2004","Executive Director","Vermont Community Loan Fund","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10358847","http://www.investinvermont.org"," "," "," "," ","Montpelier, Vermont, United States","Financial Services","🦆-default-invited","",

I find it all fascinating. The most fun part for me is diving deep into an organization to learn what they do, how they do it, where they want to go, how to best improve upon it and how to best communicate it to the world. Building the right solutions is challenging and never the same for any two organizations. The process can be seen by some as intrusive, nosey, unnecessary. Organizations, especially smaller ones, hold their business close to their chest, protecting it from being whisked away by another to build to the levels of what they have always envisioned. But to do my job best, it just can't be approached this way. I prefer to be thought of as a partner and ally. Those that agree, well we get to really see fantastic things happen. The whole process is simply a blast. I do love what I do! After many years of photography, design and business ownership, I am now partners with Margaret Donovan at Temblor Creative Group. We, along with our fantastic staff and freelance partners, have taken Temblor to great places in our first few years. We are constantly learning and evolving to bring Temblor and our clients great growth. Oh, and yes... we love what we do! Prior to this 2010 business startup, I launched, operated and sold two successful businesses - moved, twisted along with all the changes in photography and graphic design, managing to make the leap well before the photo industry crash collapse. Gathering experience and hitting the books along the way (masters in Internet Strategy and Marketing about ten years ago) I combined it all to do what I do today.

By the time I was in college I was creating print ads and writing radio spots for my parents’ small business. Thirty plus years later the cassette is long gone, but my love of crafting messages that resonate is still going strong.  Growing up in an entrepreneurial family I learned three things. First - if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well (or as my father would say, “don’t half-a$$ it”). Second - work doesn’t stop because it’s 5:00. Third - it all comes down to relationships, and relationships begin by sharing information. I’ve been part of small businesses and multi-billion-dollar, global entities. I’ve led international marketing teams and I have been the marketing team. Regardless of the industry or size of the organization, success comes down to the ability to tell a story in a way that resonates with your audience. I excel at telling stories.  Do you struggle with: •	Knowing how to position or talk about your products and services? •	Connecting with your target audience? •	Providing your sales team with effective tools? •	Keeping prospects engaged through the sales process? •	Developing lasting relationships with clients?  Content is your secret sauce. When created around your message and goals, and targeted to your audience, content creates a foundation for relationships that lead to sales and revenue growth. Not sure where to start? Let’s connect here on LinkedIn and see how I can help.   heather@rootmktg.com  ","2018","Principal and Founder","Root Marketing"," "," "," "," "," ","HFC15","Greater Burlington Area","Marketing and Advertising","🦆-default-invited","",

I grew up working in my father’s Hotel in Essex starting at a young age, and went on to manage that property in 1998. In 2005, innovating thinking brought us to convert that hotel to condominiums, still maintaining ownership on some condos for future rentals. This is what started my career in the real estate field, and brought on the inception of my own company, Vision Property Management. Continuing with my father, we worked together to develop Essex’s premier apartment complex, The Lofts Essex in 2013 housing 54 quality apartments in which my company also manages. Looking to take the next step in real estate, I became a Realtor with REMAX North Professionals, The Condo Guy Team. I recently made the decision to go out on my own and joined Keller Williams Realty. Formerly Vision Real Estate, in February 2018 I re-branded to Rockstar Real Estate Collective. Combining two of my passions, music and real estate, into one name one look. I bring my high energy, real estate background and drive for customer satisfaction to KW and look forward to helping you in your exciting new venture in life.","2015","Realtor","Keller Williams","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1458916","http://www.lisawyatt.com"," "," "," "," ","Essex Junction, Vermont, United States","Real Estate","🦆-default-invited","",

I take the time to really learn my clients'​ wants and needs to help find the perfect property or sell a current home. As a listing agent, I provide my clients with enough solid information to make an honest, informed decision based upon facts not hype. My goal is to sell their home for the highest price in the shortest period of time, and with the fewest hassles.  As a buyer's agent, I guide my clients in their home search by providing listings that are a good match, showing them homes and offering my recommendations based on my past experience and local knowledge. I walk them through each step of the buying process from securing financing to closing.

As a Realtor since 2002 and as a Vermont resident for over a decade, I am a devoted advocate for the Stowe area and surrounding community and the real estate market for our region. My experience as a Pall Spera mentee and as a Realtor for the Lamoille County region has led me to develop an expertise in exceptional service, extensive market knowledge, integrity, and attention to detail. As a result of serving as both secretary and president of the Lamoille Area Board of Realtors, I have developed a broad network of colleagues, increasing my reach throughout central and northern Vermont. I maintain a sincere investment in the success of my clients, which differentiates myself from traditional brokers, and has created a fiercely loyal customer base. There is no greater compliment than a client recommending me and the service I provide to someone they know… This is how I measure success. I relocated to Vermont on a full-time basis in 2002, but first vacationed in Vermont as a child - in fact, I learned to ski here. My commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle balance is helped by enjoying the wide variety of outdoor activities Vermont has to offer with my husband David and our two dogs. As in my professional life, my favorite aspect of living in Vermont is its residents. We have a great mix of people here — the relaxed visitors enjoying their leisure time, and those who live and work in our communities. I am lucky to have a deep passion for what I do. I love this business. I never tire of learning about people’s lives and families, and work hard to maintain a relevant market perspective in an ever-changing industry… but my true passion lies in helping people transition with ease and move forward with their hopes and dreams.","2013","Managing Broker","The Bateman Group at Pall Spera Company Realtors","https://www.linkedin.com/company/10561221","http://www.thebatemangrouprealtors.com"," "," "," "," ","Stowe, Vermont, United States","Real Estate","🦆-default-invited","",

For a very long time... quite embarrassing actually, I struggled in multiple network marketing companies. I joined more companies than I care to admit.

Flea markets and trade shows. 3-way calls Text, Emailed, messenger, you name it. It was frustrating and I was faced with rejection at every turn. Sure, I recruited a few people here and there. But they never duplicated. They weren't willing to do all of the crazy things I was. They then disappeared... Sound familiar? I then turned to the internet and engulfed myself into training and information to learn a better way and in 2016 that lead me to creating a full-time income and a successful business from home.

It’s created. In my 20+ years as a business owner and graphics installation expert, if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that opportunity is where you seek it. Keeping an eye on what’s new, what works and what doesn’t means that I’ve never hesitated to respond to rapidly changing market needs, learn the most cutting edge technology, and reinvent myself and my business as times called for it. —I turned a 100-year-old business on the brink of closing to stable profitability and 7-figure revenues by slashing outdated services and leveraging key trends —Demand for graphics on non-traditional media like auto wraps. Ours was one of the few firms that tapped niche B2B markets like OEM, retail and offices.   —I was of the first to own an SLR digital camera in Vermont and launch a digital photo studio at premier pre-press company.  —Where other school and event photography firms continue to wait for photos, I built Instant Images, LLC from scratch, transforming the local market with digital technology. Customers leave the event with photos in hand, a service offered by no other in my region. My other primary takeaway: You can’t knock trust.  It trumps everything else, whether dealing with team, client or supplier relationships. The focus has to be on quality, to build and maintain that trust. —Taking over an OEM market account, Bombardier Transportation, where the previous supplier had failed, I restored faith through meticulous trouble-shooting and testing, innovating the best graphic installation methods for 300+ double-decker trains. —Earning preferred supplier status for 21-site healthcare client remodel, my team created files and installed 300+ feet of graphics in just a few days. I welcome the chance to discuss how bringing an eye for opportunity, built on a foundation of quality and trust, can help your racing, graphics, or educational organization meet its most pressing challenges. 	 - Doug Bergstrom, douglas.bergstrom@gmail.com","2000","President","Xtreme Grafix","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1924211","http://www.xgsigns.com"," "," "," ","xgsigns","St Albans, Vermont, United States","Marketing and Advertising","🦆-default-invited","",

Since my father's death in 1987, my focus has been on empowering others to create the cultural environments they want and need. Over the past 40 plus years, I have assisted several hundred organizations in their culture change efforts. I’ve served as an editor of the American Journal of Health Promotion and authored more than 50 books, journal articles and training manuals on leadership, household wellness, peer support, social climate, cultural analysis, organizational purpose, and systematic culture change. I’ve trained over 500 human resources and wellness professionals to be effective Culture Coaches. During 2020, I collaborated with Richard Safeer, MD, Chief Medical Director, Employee Health and Well-being at Johns Hopkins Medicine and Ewa Stelmasiak, MS, MSc, founder and owner of the Wellness Institute. We recorded over 160 HealthyCultureNow podcast episodes about creating cultures of well-being. The podcast and associated training has three audiences: (1) human resources and well-being professionals, (2) executives and middle-managers, and (3) employees and other individual VIPs. I see the toolkit as a valuable addition to current worksite wellness and health promotion programs.  My goal this year is to use this toolkit to empower over 100 companies to build cultures of well-being. We will be adding episodes that feature conversations with individuals engaged in creating supportive cultural environments. Further information about this initiative is available at www.healthyculturenow.com. I recently created the Healthy Culture Research and Education Fund. Although I am pleased that the vast majority of community and business leaders appreciate the importance of culture, I am confident that this research will add to our understanding of how to create supportive cultural environments.

One of my main strengths lies in my ability to analyze problems and come up with unconventional solutions. As a dyslexic, I have always viewed my 'disability' as a strength; seeing things from a different angle is second nature to me. I feel my opportunities are limitless and I endeavor to improve each company I join. I am a clear communicator with an unbreakable positivity. I gain energy from social interactions, both in person and online. My ideal position is one where I will be able to create events and marketing content for the company, clients, or customers I represent. I look to constantly create engaging experiences that create tangible feedback, encourage building relationships with customers and industry professionals with a special attention to celebrating fine spirits, wine and/or beer.  With a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Entrepreneurship gained in May 2016, I joined D.W. Voigt CPA P.C. as Office Manager while maintaining my position at Mad River Distillers. Through this experience I gained a new appreciation for time management, professional services, client communications, and increased my flexibility in juggling tasks between two very different titles. Reviewing the experience gained in from in these two positions, I realized I sought a position with a company where I felt my voice would be heard. I have an intermediate understanding of the french language and it is a skill I seek to improve.  I have been continuing to improve my skills with keen attention to adding professional marketing and social media experience to my resume. Working with Stellar Property Solutions as a consultant, I've been working on creating a custom marketing plan to reach their target market in an unexplored way.

I was raised on rural Vermont land, while my family logged, produced maple syrup, dairy farmed (for 9 generations!), and my family and I raised Christmas trees on 65 acres in the central part of the state. The decades of my involvement in realizing the environmentally sensitive nature on which Vermont farms, homes, estates, or commercial operations are built is – quite simply – in my DNA. From the types of soils in the fields to determining if there are sugar maples in the woods, to ensuring that logging and clearing are done responsibly, I can help you with these considerations and so much more.  I can also: • recommend where you should access your property • provide advice on how to construct your road appropriately • tell you how to orient your new home to maximize views and available sunlight • assess whether a pond area is possible to make your property even more desirable A LAND SPECIALIST MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO FIND THE RIGHT PROPERTY FOR YOU You want to buy a parcel of land that will be the right fit for you and your family. A bonus might be to add value to your investment by discovering what other natural assets already exist to enhance that investment.  Essentially, I want to help you with your Vermont land real estate purchase to build lasting memories in a beautiful place, which inspires and comforts you. A special place for you to call home.

No matter which Land Rover you drive, Congleton Service can expertly repair your vehicle. We also offer an extensive collection of quality and hard-to-find Land Rover parts on our web store, all vetted by our team of technicians. Our in-house engineer is also creating direct-fit replicas of parts that are no longer available from Land Rover. Our proprietary Congleton Service parts are even more durable than the originals they are replacing.  At Congleton Service, we believe in originality and evolutionary improvement. While those two things are seemingly in conflict with each other, they’ve kept us firmly on the course we intended. We use the words above to decide what improvements should be made and what modifications would destroy the soul of the truck and the long-term value of our restorations. We improve these trucks for performance, reliability, safety, and comfort, but we won’t insult the men who designed them and built them by hand many years ago. We think the boys in Solihull would have figured out how to rust-proof the trucks, so we do it. We don’t think they’d bolt in Chevrolet/Corvette LS crate engines, so we don’t do that. We do hand-build Rover V8s that are more reliable than the originals and much more powerful because we think they would have continued improving the engine as they’d been doing for decades. There’s a place for highly-modified vehicles and we’ve owned more than our share… it’s just not what we do here. These are the world’s most iconic SUVs, rebuilt by hand and with a lot of pride in Colchester, Vermont.  Stop by www.congletonservice.com to learn more.

I’m Gary Horsman & I love helping people market their business online and build competition-beating online content. This is the core of content marketing. My mission is to help you define content for your business to improve your search position and then engage visitors to convert them into your customers. I help you to create content to increase your ability to inspire and impress people about your products & services. I also realize that you are busy and have 101 things to do. I know that you never get your “to do” list done. The good news is that you do not have to do it all with the resources you now have. Consider increasing your team expertise by adding A Global Reach to your project team. Let us help. People are Googling for your products and services. I know this and you know this. Do they find you? Are you missing out on opportunities? Is your website or blog getting traffic? Is it engaging people? Do not let opportunities slip away or perhaps never even present themselves in the first place. Do you know what it takes to be found properly when someone Googles your products or services? Well, I do.

How can I help? Connections and relationships are everything, they always have been and always will be. Even in these digital spaces fast times there is someone behind the link or the picture. Let's find out what we can do to contribute to each other.  So who am I? I've been in sales, marketing, and business growth about 26yrs now. I started out of high school got into the school of hard knocks selling cars, quickly realized I didn't know everything and started a quest to be the best I could be. I'm still on that quest and continue to find people that are doing the same. We sometimes do it a little different but in the end we wake up with goals of what we want to and find others like minded 'birds of a feather flock together.' Last year we started a non-profit to help homeless and veterans live better, by teaching them financing believing in themselves and arranging affordable homes for them to build equity, and increase their value. I believe we are here to make a difference, and that is what I intend to do. As I write this I just got a text from a friend of mine that said thank you for being there for me when I was ready to walk out. Another one of clients just posted how he got 3 new jobs this week from the strategies we set up 2 wks ago. I'm a results guy, I push myself to be a little better today than yesterday. When things are going great I remember Today is the Day the Lord has Made and I will Rejoice and be Glad in it. Keeping things simple and congruent is one of the rules I live by.  Studying Tony Robbins, Brian Tracy and reading hundreds of books over the years inspires me that we really are here to contribute to leave a mark and to not bury our talents in the sand. Use what you have understand there are more resources and in this day it's all about working smarter not harder. I hope to connect to you to get to know you and if there is anything I can do to help, It my purpose in life.  As a Husband and father with 5 kids and 11 grand kids now, family and time is the most important thing we all need to strive for (in the end), no one ever says I wish I would have spent more time working. I hope to hear from you and if you feel there is room for improvement I'll find it and we'll make it happen.   To your Highest Success Be Blessed!

After realizing that my true passion was the emerging science of mind/body medicine, or psychoneuroimmunology, I entered the National College of Natural Medicine. After earning my Naturopathic Doctorate (N.D.), with an emphasis on classical homeopathy, I was selected for the  NCNM Family Medicine Residency Program. During this residency, I gained hundreds of extra hours of clinical training. I also participated in the OHSU Integrative Medicine Program as part of a team consisting of a chiropractor, a medical doctor, and an acupuncturist that collaborated to solve medical problems. Throughout my training and early years of private practice, I have been unsatisfied with the tools available for treating chronic disease.  I have always had a firm belief that the human body has an ability to heal itself, and that the best medicine complements and supports this ability. After five years of private practice, I developed a method of approaching the patient from a complex systems perspective that better works with the macro effects of human physiology.  Most of medicine focuses on breaking down the body into smaller and smaller pieces in hopes of increasing understanding.  My goal is to better understand the holistic nature of the interactions of emotions, spirit, the physical body, and mental health.

When I first started in the business, I had no idea how important my services would be to so many clients, their families and their businesses. Just a few years after I started, our nation endured 9/11, multiple wars, huge market downturns where so many lost their life savings, and years of a lackluster economy that left many unemployed. That's the bad news. During this time in my career, I have helped clients through hardship and loss of loved ones with life insurance planning that helped their children move on and pay for the college education that their parents dreamed they would receive. I have stood with those in times of need as they said goodbye to their husband or wife, father or mother, comforting them in troubled moments when they could barely think of how they would have an income now that one has moved on. I have helped protect numerous families as the markets took huge losses of close to 40%, and shown them a way to never outlive what they have worked so hard to save. Now many are living comfortably and the only complaints I hear are that the weather is too hot in their winter get-away!  Today is a complicated world, navigating it alone is not easy. The days of 'Do it yourself' life, health and retirement planning are no longer. It is not as easy as checking yourself out at Home Depot or filling your tank at the self-serve gas station. I certainly would never tell the doctor that I can do surgery on myself! Professional services are important, and that's what I offer my clients. My services are at no cost, my time is free, if I see you in person, I pay for my own gas! But what I can do for you, your family and business is invaluable! My recommendations are based on experience, my partner companies' experience, and the needs that I help uncover.  Thank you.

She has worked throughout the world for 35 years with individuals and groups, guiding them to connect to and access their soul’s calling.  Through listening to and connecting with the soul, we catalyze our potential and open to inner understanding, which assists us to live our congruent vibration. Living in this vibration keeps our interactions, choices and decisions compatible with our purpose, which links us to our part of the design. This awareness is supported individually through understanding our Thought Wave Form SM a unique wave that shows how we think and pattern our responses to everything in our world. We learn what actually happens when we get “stuck,” and how to shift our perception to experience more balance and peace. Through this Accelerated Thinking Process SM profound changes are also possible for those with learning challenges, or cognitive pattern disruptions such as ADD that affect functioning and states of being. Flo trains teachers and facilitators, certifying them to offer programs that she has developed such as: Soul Recognition (SR) an ancient and shamanic journey that aligns and anchors the energy, purpose, and patterning of the soul consciously into the body and life. SR releases energetic and karmic blocks re-patterning the conditioning held in the physical, mental and emotional levels. Circuitry Alignment unifies our original blueprint within the cells and systems of our body. HeartThread is an effective yet easy way to shift long-standing physical patterns that inhibit our full health and expression.

I’m fortunate that my career path has exposed me to Lead Scoring & Routing, Lifetime Value Modeling, Complex Attribution Modeling, Conversion Funnel Optimization, Affiliate Management, Vendor Management, Affinity Fulfillment, Custom CMS Design, custom CRM Applications, Website Design, and Custom ETL & Database Projects. Every business can benefit from the proper application of technology, digital advertising tactics, and technical expertise. I believe that every dollar spent on digital ads should bring with it something learned, something that makes us more efficient, more profitable, or otherwise better tomorrow than we were yesterday.

Having graduated from one of the top-ranked programs in Organizational Behavior, I studied with the leading scholars of Appreciative Inquiry, Emotional Intelligence, and Experiential Learning Theory. My work has been published in a variety of journals and books, appearing most recently in the Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship, and presented at national and international conferences, including the Annual Academy of Management Meetings. I recently served as a guest editor for a special issue on positive organizational ethics for the Journal of Business Ethics.  My career, however, extends beyond the walls of academia and into practice as well. During my time at Case Western, I helped launch the Center for Business as Agent of World Benefit, which sought to highlight and foster the many ways that businesses can be a force for positive social change around the globe. I also remain very active in the Appreciative Inquiry community of practitioners, serving as a Co-Chair for past World Appreciative Inquiry Conferences held in Florida and  then Nepal, and on the Advisory Board for the conferences in Belgium and South Africa. I guest edited a special issue on advances in the AI Summit for the AI Practitioner Journal, as well as served as the co-editor for the 4th volume in the research book series Advances in Appreciative Inquiry.  I present regularly at national and international conferences, including most recently the International Positive Psychology World Congress. With a passion for helping organizations leverage their potential through strength-based change, I have consulted with a wide variety of organizations including: Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the VTFEA, World Vision, Houston Independent School District, The California Teachers Association, Imagine Nepal, The United Nations, the American Society of Association Executives, and the Leahy Center for Lake Champlain, among others.","2018","Robert P.

I’ve learned that creating order out of chaos & enabling & empowering others is my calling.  I resisted this initially, as I embarked on a career as a programmer. However, it became clear that my purpose wasn’t to develop killer code but to help other developers and teams succeed by better organizing their work & eliminating unnecessary churn.  This discovery opened the 2nd stage of my journey - learning to lead. After an unexpected departure of my manager, I was thrown into a management role which forced me to dig deep into my own capabilities and beliefs about leadership.  It wasn’t always elegant, but I eventually discovered how to provide the structure and support to help others excel.   Whether it was small projects or global teams, I’ve learned that there are three principles that are at the heart of project success: ➡️ Focus on building & nurturing the relationships that enable performance and agility ➡️ Create the climate and the structure that serves as scaffolding to success ➡️ Eliminate chaos and churn that distracts the team from it's core work This realization led to the 3rd stage in my journey - building a business focused on helping others. In 2010, I launched Newgrange IT Consulting to help clients transform their organizations by delivering their most important initiatives. I am passionate about helping clients develop a culture of delivering the right results for their organization.  We are focused on our clients’ success, so we work to align their strategy with execution.  We build strong collaborative teams to ensure that the initiative will succeed. We reduce their risk, fast-track their results and empower & enable their teams. ➡️ What clients have said after working with me: “Annmarie brings project/program management experience integrated into a practical and understandable framework for driving meaningful transformation across an organization. Relentlessly curious, she is the penultimate questioner, planner and mentor at the same time. She has a high expectation of herself to add value and does so by bringing her extensive experience to the table. Annmarie's value-add is simple - she transforms.” ➡️ To see how I can help you and your team, email me at: Annmarie.Curley@NewgrangeITConsulting.com #leadership #management  #managementconsulting #Workday","2010","Project Management Consulting & Managed Services","Newgrange IT Consulting - NewgrangeITConsulting.com","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1368801","http://www.newgrangeitconsulting.com","annmarie.curley@newgrangeitconsulting.com","802-4482490"," ","annmariecurley","Shelburne, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited|Sent Blog 1","",

During the past year, businesses also started contacting me for team building and staff events. Groups range from 8-30 people.

The guiding principle I used when co-founding this business was how to make it easier for companies in Financial Services to find great speakers, coaches and industry experts to fulfill their specific business needs.  The idea is simple – a “one-stop” shop where I match your organization to the right speaker that will deliver a remarkable experience at your next event. And, it is all done for the same price as if you had called the speaker yourself. I believe that clients should get more and not have to pay when working with a speakers’ bureau.    I can’t stand the thought of world class organizations engaging a speaker who over-promises, under-delivers and jeopardizes the success and return on investment of a conference or roadshow.  It’s why I spend a lot of time getting to know the speakers I work with and passing these relationships onto my clients. It drives me crazy when an organization brings in a speaker and there is no focus on what should happen after the event. I believe speakers need to focus on key takeaways and actionable strategies. This is why I developed the RMA Speaker-Connect process which puts as much focus on the pre- and post aspects of the event, as it does on the event itself.

I can help. I’m a data scientist with a strong curiosity, a creative mind, and strong work ethic.  I am interested in working on complicated problems that have many intertwined quantitative and qualitative properties and finding actionable insights for stakeholders.  Such as modeling social systems(digital marketing/financial markets), economic markets, and the impacts of sustainable business practices on the economy/financial markets.  Very interested in GIIRS, B Analytics, SASB standards and other efforts to use measurement and data to facilitate businesses optimizing for sustainable goals. Professionally, I have an extensive experience in managing computer systems(networks, software of all types, databases, etc…).  Everything from desktop support tech to managing a 30 person IT department.  The result is I feel very comfortable working with new technologies and managing most data engineering issues.         Since 2009 I’ve been analyzing complex data sets(stochastic modeling, data mining, factor analysis, machine learning, etc…) working with Fixed Income financial data(CDO’s, Mortgage Backed Securities, Attribution, etc…), digital traffic/marketing data(Google Analytics, proprietary web metrics, digital advertising, SEO, etc…), and utility CRM data to measure the impact of marketing on energy savings. Academically, I studied complex networks and systems, stochastic differential equations, numerical methods and probability.  The result is a toolbox of quantitative methods developed for analyzing non-deterministic systems as well as knowledge and experience applying those methods with software systems(R, Matlab, SQL, Hadoop, Impala, Hive, etc...).","2019","Chief Data Scientist","Doer/Maker","https://www.linkedin.com/company/35668103","http://www.doermaker.com","sitterlyb@gmail.com"," "," ","sitterlyb","Burlington, Vermont, United States","Marketing and Advertising","🦆-default-invited|Sent Blog 1","",

Reina helps organizations build and rebuild trust and exceed business goals through the power of human connection, no matter the company size, structure, location or market challenges. Trust Building makes these organizations measurably more energetic, adaptive and capable.  Reina's clients include AMEX, Ben & Jerry’s, Dartmouth Hitchcock Healthcare, Harvard University, Johnson & Johnson, Lincoln Financial Group, MillerCoors, Nokia, Toyota, Turner Broadcasting, Walt Disney World, and the United States Treasury Department, to name a few. Dennis and Michelle have written two award winning, business best selling books, which have been published in multiple languages: “Trust and Betrayal in the Workplace: Building Effective Relationships in Your Organization” and “Rebuilding Trust in the Workplace: Seven Steps to Renew Confidence, Commitment, and Energy.” Their work has been featured in Bloomberg, Business Week, Harvard Management Update, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time magazine, and USA Today. They have been featured on TV and radio networks, such as CNBC and CNN and have received several awards, including the World HRD Congress Global Strategic Leadership Award. In the field of organizational trust, Dennis and Michelle are pioneers. When they started consulting in 1991, Dennis and Michelle’s practice focused on how to create self-directed work teams and fix broken change efforts. While all the literature talked about how critical trust was in accomplishing those things, none of the literature gave explicit instructions on how to build trust or how to help when trust had been severed. Dennis and Michelle began a comprehensive study of trust-building, and applied their learning in organizations to build trust-fueled cultures. A particularly satisfying part of their work is how clients integrate the trust-building concepts into all aspects of life. Says Michelle: “People tell us that, not only has the company culture transformed, but so have their relationships at home. They teach the trust concepts to their family, which deepens the relationships and ends up changing lives.”","1990","Chief Trust Building® Officer | Founder","Reina Trust Building®","https://www.linkedin.com/company/858696","http://www.reinatrustbuilding.com/","dsreina@reinatrustbuilding.com","(802) 253-8808"," ","DrDennisReina","Stowe, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited|Sent Blog 1","",

After my partners (and parents) retired from our family operated limousine business in Chicago, I found myself surrounded in an era when female bosses were a rarity. Somehow, I managed to keep nearly 40 limo drivers in line, and on time. Not an easy task when their default mode was cranky. I know the trauma and the scarce joys of keeping a small business afloat. After a lifetime of self-employment and marketing other family-owned and operated businesses, my expertise inspired the launch of Insights, LLC. Today I find myself surrounded by a team of energetic, creative minds in love with the concept of constant innovation and the chance to help small business owners achieve big things. The relationships I've formed along the way are my true life's love. My team and I are proud to have helped so many folks take their businesses to the next level. Whether we're building their website, formulating a marketing strategy, or empowering them to do it themselves through our workshops, we help make their journey a little easier and their dreams a little closer. Our goal is to become more than their full-service marketing partners, we want to be the agency they can always trust and the extended family who shares in their success.

Working Fields is an innovative solution to assist individuals with hurdles finding employment due to issues arising from substance use addiction, criminal convictions and other barriers largely associated with systemic poverty.  Working Fields works with Employers using a similar model as traditional staffing agencies by filling open positions at the Client Employer.  The  Working Fields model differs starting with the onboarding process and continues through the assignment.  The 'Associate' is supported by Working Fields with a Recovery Coach that meets weekly with the Associate while on assignment.  The Recovery Coach supports the Associate on any and all areas of a person's recovery where help is needed or simply providing support through the day to day challenges of recovery.  In addition, the Associate has an Account Manager that provides support on all things related to the assignment. With this supportive model an Associate has a greater chance of success in their job as well as their recovery.

You've probably heard her name before, whether it was through her regular advertisements in the Burlington Free Press, one of her informative columns about Real Estate or one of the many For Sale signs she has all over Northwestern Vermont. Chances are you know someone who has worked with, purchased or sold a home through Geri. She is a dedicated professional selling over 150 homes a year. It is Geri’s consistent, professional service that allows her to be one of the few Realtors in Vermont who is able to make the statement, 'Thousands of Homes Sold'. Geri became a Realtor shortly after graduating from the University of Vermont in 1979 and quickly became a top producer. She has been a top residential real estate agent since 1983 and top overall company salesperson from 1986 to 2008. She was Partner at Coburn and Feeley Real Estate, Inc. from 1990 to 1997. From 1997 until July 2010 she maintained her high sales performance and was the number one residential real estate producer with Coldwell Banker Hickok & Boardman Realty. She also ranked the number one Coldwell Banker agent in Vermont from 2000-2009 and was ranked within the top ten in the Northeast region. It was only natural for Geri Reilly to open her own real estate firm in 2010 after 29 years of working independently for other various firms. Her entire team followed including her husband, Mike Simoneau who heads the commercial division.

It's life insurance for the change makers.  Your Bluestone policy has a powerful ripple effect for good in our world. So how did I get here?  I’m a Green Mountain Girl who lived and worked as an adaptive marketer and brand evangelist in NYC for almost 20 years.  Then, I returned to my home state of Vermont in 2005.  From 2005-2011, I ran my marketing & branding business from my log cabin, serving clients all over the world from Hong Kong and Seoul to New York and London. In 2012, I began an invigorating run at National Life Group, a Top 10 insurance company located in Montpelier, VT.   I’ve worked across industries and am adept at immersing myself and getting quickly to the heart of a challenge.  I believe marketing is both an art and a science, and that the best ideas and innovations often come from outside an industry and show up in unexpected places.  I am a consummate communicator and collaborator.  I know how to lead and inspire teams, and how to get at the authentic core of a brand.  I'm a diplomat by nature and a music lover who regularly gets inspired by a song or a band.  I believe in the power of 'think different.'  I am a MAC who plays well with PCs. I've co-authored two books and taught at both NYU and American University.  I love the written and spoken word, and am often intoxicated by the voices of NPR as a I travel the byways of New England.  I am that person who sometimes has to pull the car over when I am overtaken by a song, an audio book or a podcast...and have had innumerable NPR “driveway moments.” I believe in joy and the power of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary.

In order to thrive in a healthy and productive manner, each and every one of us needs to be willing to deal with our own personal set of limitations and beliefs.  Organizational transformation gives us a unique opportunity to do just that. After all, most of us do not choose the people we work with or the design of the organization. But we can make it more of what we know is possible and create more freedom and joy for ourselves and those around us.  There is no straight line from point A, old culture, to point B, new culture. Culture change is a messy, time-consuming and energy-draining endeavor. It is also invigorating, exciting and endlessly rewarding. Specialties: Be more productive, alive and effective at work. Work toward high performance that allows for creativity, encouraging innovation and breakthrough thinking. Learn how to remain centered and focused during stress. Look at difficult people; bosses, co-workers, customers and peers as an opportunity to transform and learn about yourself rather then shut down or be negatively impacted.

The Northeast Kingdom of Vermont is rural, gorgeous, remote and perfect.  I've had my real estate license since 1979, and started Big Bear RE with my mom back in 1988.  She's since retired, and the Bears den now consists of this amazing family we've established in our little office.  We keep it simple and follow the Golden Rule.  What we lack in size, we make up for in service, professionalism and enthusiasm.  I find it so satisfying to help first time buyers realize the dream of home ownership, and helping someone find the perfect piece of heaven just for them and their families.  The process can be daunting, but years of experience can soften the edges and make things run smoothly. We're happy to give teddy bears at the closings to both buyers and sellers.  At Christmas time, we make our famous chocolate walnut fudge and deliver it to customers and clients along with a bear ornament.  It's a fun tradition and something we love to do.  The best compliment we can ever receive is a referral.  Over the years, it seems that we've had lots of repeat business. I'm so happy to admit that some of my favorite people and best friends started as customers and/or clients.  I've been REALTOR OF THE YEAR in 1997 and 2007 for the Orleans County Board of Realtors.  I'm the local Director for the Vermont Realtors and have been actively involved with local and state positions. In my spare time, I enjoy yoga, skiing, walking, running, riding my motorcycle, but especially enjoying the company of my family and friends.  My children have blessed me with 7 grandchildren, and they are the highlight of my world.  Family is so important.","1979","Owner","Big Bear Real Estate"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Troy, Vermont, United States","Real Estate","🦆-default-invited","",

A move to Vermont in 1999 with my husband Bob brought us to Townshend. I find real estate sales to be a very rewarding career as my customers and clients call me to serve. There is no manipulation, no compulsion, my sellers want to sell their home, my buyers want to purchase a home and they appreciate my experience, expertise and assistance as we work together to further those goals. As Broker and Owner of Barrett & Valley Associates, Inc., I enjoy interaction with clients, customers, brokers and agents.  Real Estate is never boring and I love the competitive business environment. This is a skill based industry with ever increasing technical and legislative changes.  Our agents have a solid knowledge of the community which is imperative as the market becomes global.  We perform our duties with an attitude of service and continue to remain at the top of sales in most of the towns where we work. The market may be international but real estate sales remain local and require knowledge that only local agents can offer. I believe in education, and have earned the Graduate, REALTOR® Institute (GRI) designation as well as the Seller Representative Specialist (SRS) designation, Senior Real Estate Specialist (SRES) and am currently working towards the Accredited Buyer’s Representative (ABR®) designation and e-PRO® certification. I currently serve as the President of the Crown Point Board of Realtors where I have previously served as President, Director and State Director receiving the coveted 'Realtor of the Year' award. I have spent many years on the Townshend Planning Commission, three years as a town auditor and am a Director on Valley Cares Board.  Family time is spent with our children, their spouses and our grandchildren.

Discussions of all phases of buying and selling real estate were a constant at all family gatherings.   Knowledge gained through this exposure, combined with education, experience and a first hand understanding of the current real estate market have allowed me to successfully serve my clients in all phases of the purchase and sales process. Since graduating from college in the area, my home and work have been in Killington. Living and working in the high energy atmosphere of Killington allows me to participate in a variety of activities and constantly expand my knowledge of the area.       I can provide clients who are purchasing real estate with details that go far beyond the listing data, and for current homeowners who are in the process of listing, I can realistically provide guidelines for successful listing and sales of their property. My experience covers land and real property, primary and second homes and investment property sales and rentals.

She managed Vermont’s largest independent batterer intervention program through interdisciplinary collaborative networks with the Department of Corrections, the Department for Children and Families, and nonprofit organizations. As director of the Consumer Affairs division at the Vermont Department of Public Service, Autumn developed policy positions that balanced stakeholder needs while aligning with regulatory requirements. Autumn has brought her expertise as a professional development facilitator to state and national conferences, on a training envoy to Morocco with the U.S. Department of State, and to her own staff as a means of meeting their professional certification requirements. In both nonprofit and unionized public environments she has overhauled staff evaluation practices to turn them into an opportunity for confidence-building, personal ownership, and targeted growth. Sometimes, the best way to affect people’s lives is through improving systems, analyzing data, and creative design. With data gathered through qualitative or quantitative methods, Autumn determines what is happening, why, and what to do about it. For one project, commissioned by the State of Vermont, Autumn served as lead topical expert to research and collaboratively design new personnel policies, which have since been adopted by the state and by private employers.  Autumn enjoys a dynamic schedule that includes a private practice as a psychotherapist in addition to her work with BUILD.

I purchased a small children's consignment shop with only 250 sq ft. I believe in a green business, and a community business. I now have over 10,000 sq ft, located in a restored turn of the century department store on Main St. in Brattleboro, Vt. When I was told it is best to 'link in' with like businesses, I could not find any, so I created them within my store. First adding adult consignment fashion, then furniture, and finally a dealer mall with multiple dealer rental space. I have over 100 dealers, who rent space in my shop for their items, creating a wide diversity of goods. I also have 3,500 consignors, who reflect the diversity of life styles and cultures, with the items they wish to sell. I find that by being a business that incorporates a large amount of different but like businesses in one location, first offers the community a place to recycle and buy recycled goods, but also an exciting place to 'find' that perfect treasure, as new stock is added daily.  Now after being in business almost 27 years, I have found a new market of clients that have an entire home to liquidate either due to a loss in the family, or a move. I now have a new business, Twice Onsite, Professional Estate & Relocation Sales. I now can put all my years in business to help clients, not only sell the contents of their home faster, but help to alleviate the stress of an emotionally charged situation. We also stage each home to help to sell the property for our clients, bringing hundreds of potential buyers to the sale. At an on site sale, we can sell anything from the low to the high with ease, unlike my store, Twice Upon A Time Antiques, which only has the capacity to sell antiques,collectible, jewelry, vintage clothing and good used furniture and decor. Twice Onsite offers this alternative to the wholesale market of auction, flea markets, and yard sales.","2013","Founder & President","Twice Onsite"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Brattleboro, Vermont, United States","Retail","🦆-default-invited","",

Congress enacted these programs in 1981.  They were enhanced over the years and broadened even more with the 2018 tax overhaul.  More businesses than ever now qualify.  Construction, Manufacturing, Fabrication, Medical, Technology, Energy, Printing, Engineering, Funeral Homes, Service Business ... just a few of the industries we are able to help. We look back from 3 to 10 years to find hidden money for business owners. ► Note: There is absolutely NO CHARGE to see if your business is eligible. Watch the VIDEO below. Federal, state, and local governments pay out billions of dollars every year, but billions more go unclaimed. The purpose is to reward past success and help your company develop, grow, and succeed even more. That creates jobs and grows the economy, so the government sees these entitlements as a sound investment. Regardless of business type or profession, there is an ocean of money available that 95% of eligible businesses never claim. And the 5% that did claim last year, split over $16 billion dollars.

EM-BOLT boltable embed plates offer solutions to recurring construction design and installation challenges, such as thermally broken steel-to-concrete connections.      As the Business Operations Manager at EM-BOLT, I am really excited to see the this new company take off, and for our boltable embed plates to become accepted and welcomed into the construction industry.  I'm determined to overcome upcoming challenges, and am anxious to grow alongside EM-BOLT.    Jumping on board with EM-BOLT was a little intimidating at first, to be honest, but to be involved in helping launch a new business from the very beginning brings with it a huge sense of pride!  Shortly after joining the EM-BOLT team, my uneasiness faded as I realized just how revolutionary a boltable embed plate is.  It is already changing how steel-to-concrete connections are made locally, and has recently begun to gain interest on a national level.  With every connection we've made so far, - no pun intended - EM-BOLT has taken another positive turn on a very unpredicted path.  It will be very interesting to see where it will all end up! Interested in learning more about EM-BOLT and how it can save time and money on your project?   Let's connect!

I am a Dentist by profession, and lately, I've helped my wife, Dr. Lynda Ulrich, create an antidote to the daily news at EverWideningCircles.com. Our aim is to change the negative dialogue about our world by pointing people to all the newsworthy insight and innovation going uncelebrated in the mass media.  I come to that project with an unusual background: I started out as a kid from humble origins in a small farming town who had a knack for handling a basketball. Eventually, I became captain of the University of Kentucky basketball team and that started a global life. I played professionally in Spain, my wife and I became Irish citizens, we eventually both practiced dentistry in Italy, and then spent the rest of our lives traveling to unusual corners of the world with our 3 kids. I'm still a practicing dentist 4 days a week but my wife and I plan to spend the rest of our lives pointing people to all the wonder and innovation we can find.

They are both long-time peace and anti-nuclear activists who’ve had previous bookstore experience. They felt that there were many books and other materials that were difficult to find in the increasingly chain-store environment, and this is truer now than ever. Nancy feels fortunate to be working at a job that promotes peace, environmental awareness, and political change. She loves hiking, biking and cross country skiing. She reads fiction, memoir, and lots of children’s and young adult books. She and their daughter Molly Geidel authored Everyone’s Kid’s Books, an annotated guide to kids books for all kinds of children. Nancy also sells books at human services and education conferences throughout the Northeast, as well as conferences promoting peace and progressive social change. She can fulfil and supplement your required reading lists. She would be happy to put together a book fair for your event and split the profits with organizers who sell the books. E-mail or call her for more information. Rich enjoys bicycling to work and home from Putney, fixing things and of course, reading. He is a supporter of international grass-roots movements for social justice and the environment. Specialties: We’re a family owned independent bookstore specializing in books about social change, the environment, and multicultural children’s books. Many of our books are by original, creative, and progressive authors.","1984","Owner","Everyone's Books"," "," "," "," "," "," ","Brattleboro, Vermont, United States","Retail","🦆-default-invited","",

His last real job (some time ago) was as a business analyst at a leading Electronic Communications network (ECN) in Times Square, Manhattan, NY.   Paul is passionate about trading and helping traders improve their performance through his international mentoring program.  Paul has trading clients all over the world including USA, Canada, South America, and Australia.  Paul has written a book about what he has learned developing PMKing Trading titled &quot;The Complete Guide to Building a Successful Trading Business&quot;.   As well as writing articles, mini-eBooks about trading and recently having an article published in Futures Magazine, Paul is very interested in personal finance and helping his clients in Vermont become wealthier (i.e. closer to financial freedom by reducing fixed expenses and increasing passive income).   When he's not trading or helping other people trade Paul has another full-time job as father to his 8 year old son Josh.  Paul also enjoys poker (and yes, his son is a good Texas Hold'em Player already), wine and beer (but not the night before a trading day!), vegetarian cooking, chess, backgammon, and organic gardening.   Paul's philosophy on trading and life in general is summed up by the old Chinese proverb &quot;Those who say a thing is impossible should not interrupt the people doing it&quot;.

I grew up with a passion for technology and connectivity and early in my career I developed a passion for vehicles.  I've spent my career combining these two passions leading and working on teams to envision, create, develop and launch a series of products that have significantly impacted both the automotive industry and the consumer electronics industry.   Highlights include the launch of an all new big-data analytics product for Dealer.com, the award winning Infotainment system in the 2008 Cadillac CTS, a series of Integrated Center Stacks that move to reveal hidden storage, the Navigation system in the MyFord Touch system, the Chrysler uConnect system, the Chevrolet MyLink system and the Buick IntelliLink system.   I have a proven track record of generating meaningful and measurable results, including the development of scalable platforms, orchestration of international operations, increasing revenue, securing significant new business contracts and substantial growth and development of teams across multiple locations.   I have substantial public speaking experience, including at conferences such as Interior Motives China and the WardsAuto Interior's Conference.  In addition, I have acted as a company spokesperson in a variety of situations which has allowed me to develop solid relationships with key members of the media and develop substantial public relations experience.

You want to have employees taking responsibility for their work, engaged and happy customers, and make tons of money. You also want to once again have fun at work and be with people whom you consider your friends. In order to do this, you need to have a sale-ready company. This is a company that others would want to own and there's a better than even chance you have no interest in selling. Here's the challenge with this: It's really hard to run a great business where all of the above happens. Often, it seems like everything is just plainly working against you.  We believe it's not fair that you work so hard and get results (financially and emotionally) that are far less than what you want.  We understand how that feels. I've been there are way too many times I've felt the weight of the world is on my shoulders and there's no one around to help. This is why over 40 years ago I made it my mission to find simple ways to overcome those issues. Here's how we help blue-collar business owners like you: 1. The first step is find out what you want and why. We call this the alignment conversation. You'll learn what it is you want and what the gap is between where you are and what you want. 2. We only work on one thing at a time. Almost every business owner we know has a laundry list of strategic activities they want to be accomplished. We know that if there is one or two, none of them will ever get done. 3. We focus, focus, focus on those one or two things get them to the point of being done, then tackle the next thing on the list. So, the most important thing you can do to help you stay out of the weeds and figure out what you really want is to have a short conversation with us. Just use this link to set a time and date for us to talk. https://calendly.com/jpatrick/twenty-minute-free-call And, if you're not ready to talk, just yet. Get our free eBook on our Objective Review. This will outline the steps we think you should go through to create a personally and economically sustainable business. https://www.stage2planning.com/objective-review-white-paper After your conversation with us, you'll understand what you need to do to avoid burnout and instead once again love your work and company and have tons and tons of energy.","2018","Founder","The Sale Ready Company"," "," "," "," "," ","AskJoshPatrick","South Burlington, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited|Sent Blog 1","",

Nicknamed 'The Question Queen' by coworkers and clients alike, I am at my most passionate and impactful when there are problems to be solved and teams to be mobilized. Project Management provides the structure I need to tackle complex problems and I believe that everyone should have access to the powerful tools and tactics to overcome their obstacles to growth.  As a consultant, I know that it always comes back to you, your needs, and your priorities. Which is why when I founded my first company in July 2019, I chose “Echo” Consulting. The thing about an echo, is that it always comes back to you! Projects are meant to be temporary, but your success shouldn't be. That is why my recommended approach is adoption focused. Too many companies focus on picking the “right” or “best” tool or process, but struggle with the communication, change management, and adoption strategies to truly maximize the value. One of the many ways I stand out is I am not interested in relying on client dependency to grow. My goal is to build self-sufficiency, nurture champions on your team, and grow together as a community and world. Or to paraphrase one of my favorite Economics professors, sometimes to get a larger slice of pie its better to help bake a bigger pie.","2019","Project Manager and Founder","Echo Consulting, LLC","https://www.linkedin.com/company/40701612","http://echoconsultingpm.com","molly@echoconsultingpm.com","603-443-2030"," "," ","Jericho, Vermont, United States","Management Consulting","🦆-default-invited|Sent Blog 1","",

Why would someone buy your CBD products over all the others? Maybe because it’s organic, full-spectrum, or you have some nice packaging? Perhaps a slick website or a compelling founder’s story? The thing is, most other CBD brands have those things too. And with over 3,000 CBD companies competing for attention, your brand ends up looking the same. That means every day you're losing money because your CBD products are drowning in a sea of look-alikes. Don't get me wrong...unique product features and packaging are great, but they don’t help you stand out or make people feel connected to your brand.  And connecting with people so they feel like they know you is the best way to separate your products. You see, studies show that emotionally connected customers are more than TWICE as valuable as highly satisfied customers. Crazy, right? So what's the best way to connect with CBD customers? Well, by using the most direct, personal, and compliant channel you have - email. Engaging emails build know/like/trust and will boost your revenue by 20-40% percent. Sounds great, right? But that little voice is telling you it’s not that easy. How do you actually make email marketing return such awesome results?  You could try… ❌ Dazzling subscribers with more hi-res images. ❌ Bribing them with 25% discounts every 72 hours. ❌ Cramming more CTAs into every email. Nah, you can do better. Old school emails don’t cut it anymore. People don’t want ads in their inbox. You need emails that... ✅ Stand out from the garbage (and even the good stuff) in someone’s inbox. ✅ Hook readers with personality that makes them excited to open, click and buy. ✅ Break the downward spiral of needing to offer bigger and bigger discounts. You can do this, and it will change your CBD business. You'll start turning casual shoppers into long time customers. Check this out...  Here’s a customer’s response to an email I wrote for a client: “Love this! Love your message! LOVE your products! Thanks for doing what you do! I can completely relate!” Would you like to send emails that create raving fans like that? Wouldn’t it be great if I showed you how? Well, I’d be happy to! Just shoot me a message here on LinkedIn.
